# About-Me

Hi there, I'm Michael. A Geologist turned Data Analyst.

The past few years have seen me make several major changes in my life, both professionally and personally.

I graduated with a degree in Geology from the University of Houston. After getting a job at Lloyd's Register where I regularly worked with Python and SQL. This led me to start learning the basics of Data Analytics - data scraping, data cleaning, and statistical analysis.

From a personal standpoint - I spent most of my life being completely sedentary. Video games were much more interesting than a pair of running shoes. This was until I found an interest in endurance sports - particularly Triathlon.
